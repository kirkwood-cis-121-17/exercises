# Programming Exercise 9-5
#
# Program to count the occurances of each word in a text file.
# This program prompts the user for a file name,
# opens the file, finds the unique words and counts their occurrances,
# then displays the results on the screen.



# define the main function

    # declare an empty dictionary to hold word counts

    # delare an empty list to hold raw words

    # optionally, declare an empty set to hold unique words

    # define an empty string variables for file name and file content

    # Get the file name from the user

    # use a try block for i/o operations

        # open the input file for reading

        # read in the file content

        # split the file content into raw words

        # create a set of unique words from raw words

        # loop through each word in unique words

            # add word to word counts dictionary with an initial value of 0


        # loop through each word in raw words

            # increment its value in the word count dictionary


        # Display results as a table of two colums formatted to 15 columns each,
        # begin with a header line, then a separator line made of underscores

        # loop through the items in the word count dictionary, one per line
        # be sure to print the word (key) key and the occurances (value)



# Call the main function to start the program
