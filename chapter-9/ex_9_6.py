# Programming Exercise 9-6
#
# Program to compare the set of unique words in one file with that of another.
# This program takes the names of two files from the user,
# builds a set of unique words for each, then the union and intersection of them,
# and outputs the results to the screen.

# define the main function

    # define string variables for file name 1 and 2, file content 1 and 2,

    # define lists for word list 1 and 2,  

    # define sets for unique words 1 and 2, words union and words intersection
    
    # Get file name 1 from the user
    # Get file name 2 from the user


    # use a try block for file operations

        # open file input 1 using file name 1

        # read file content 1 from file input 1

        # split file content 1 into word list 1

        # create word set 1 from word list 1

        # close file input 1


        # open file input 2 using file name 2

        # read file content 2 from file input 2

        # split file content 2 into word list 2

        # create word set 2 from word list 2

        # close file input 2

        
        # get the union of word set 1 and word set 2
        # loop through and print these items that aggregate the words from both files

        # get the intersection of word set 1 and word set 2
        # loop through and print these items that overlap to appear both files


        # get the difference between word set 1 and word set 2
        # loop through and print these items contained in file 1, but not 2

        # get the difference between word set 2 and word set 1
        # loop through and print these items contained in file 2, but not 1


        # get the symetric difference between word set 1 and word set 2
        # loop through and print these items found in one file or another, not both


    # catch FileIO exceptions and display a file error message

    # catch generic exceptions and display a generic error message












# Call the main function.
main()
