# Programming Exercise 9-3a
#
# Program to encrypt a text file's content with a substitution cypher and save it.
# This program prompts the user for an input file and an output file,
# processes the input file with a character substitution function,
# then saves its content to the output file.



# to use the encypher function (which you will need to write) import cypher



# define the main function

    # define local string variables for input file name, output file name,
    # plain text, cypher text

    
    # prompt the user for an input file name

    # prompt the user for an output file name


    # surround file i/o operations with a try block

        # open the input file for reading

        # get the plain text from the input file's content

        # close the input file
    
        # pass plain text to cypher.encypher() function; store result to cypher text

        # open the output file for writing

        # write the cypher text to the output file

        # close the output file

        # disply text encrypted message


    # catch IOError and print appropriate message

    # catch generic error and print appropriate message
    


# Call the main function to start the program
