# Program to display course details for a user-supplied course number.
# This program prompts the user for a course number,
# uses it to find dictionary entries for room, instructor and time,
# then displays the associated values on the screen.



# define the main function

    # define dictionaries for room numbers, instructors and times,
    # letters appearing in course numbers should be in upper case
    # make sure the same course numbers are the key values for all dictionaries

    # define a local string variable for course to check


    # prompt the user for a course to check

    # convert the course to check to upper case

    # if course to check is not in all three dictionaries

        # print an error message

    # else

        # print the details for course to check



# Call the main function to start the program
