# Programming Exercise 9-3b
#
# Program to decrypt a file encrypted with the encypher program in cypher.py.
# This program takes a file name from the user,
# passes its contents to the decypher function in cypher.py,
# and displays the returned text on the screen.



# to use the decypher function in cypher.py, import it



# define the main function

    # declare local string variables for input file, cypher text and plain text


    # get the input file name from the user


    # use a try block for i/o operations

        # open the input file for reading

        # read the input file contents into cypher text

        # pass cypher text to cypher.decrypt and save result to plain text

        # display plain text on the screen

    # use a catch block to display a message for FileIO errors

    # use a catch block to display a message for generic erros



# Call the main function.
